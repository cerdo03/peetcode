A simple coding website using MERN stack. The website allows admin users to post questions and other users to submit solutions. Used JWT token for session management and authorization.
Trying to make the code submitted by the user run on the server side using Docker. The project is in progress, will try to find more interesting ways in which this can be implemented.
